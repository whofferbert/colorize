#
# This directory contains default rule files for colorizer.
#
# Colorizer reads all *.rules files in this directory to build it's list of working rules while running.
#
# Rules are written in the format::
/perl regex/ COLOR
#
# colorize relies on a simple grouping scheme, so make sure any groups you have are non-matching groups!
# 
# IE (?:thing|other_thing) instead of (thing|other_thing)
#
# where COLOR is any of:
